## 🎯 About the Project

This isn’t just another machine learning model.  
It’s a decision-making assistant that forecasts whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a product or service — based purely on demographic and behavioral clues.

Built using the well-known 📚 **Bank Marketing dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this project focuses on clean data handling, accurate predictions, and, most importantly, **model explainability**.
